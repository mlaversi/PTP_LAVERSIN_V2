# PTP_LAVERSIN_V2

How to run my project : That's a classic project I invite you to git clone it on your computer and try to launch the test


How to launch the test :

- On Pycharm, go on each directory 'tests' and you can press the green button next to each class to each if it works well 

- On VSCode you could have some problems with the unitest functions. 

What is wrong : 

    - Top k predictions 
    - Linked the model to the app 
    
I think i did the most difficult and i'm stopped here. If you can help me it would be great, i sent you some messages on teams and on email. If you have time to explain me it would be so great. I didn't want to take someone works so i let it like this and explain you in the html file. 

My accuracy isn't so high because i didn't have the good version of numpy and pandas accorded. But after the test with the stackover_flow file i have 

98/98 [==============================] - ETA: 0s - loss: 3.3754 - accuracy: 0.1346

If you want to train your model on a csv you have to specify in Pycharm the paths he asked for training, you can acess easily on the parameters. Or the the terminal you can add a line like this 

                python train/train/run.py "PATH/stackoverflow_posts.csv" train/conf/train-conf.yml "train/data/artefacts/"


My pist of ameliorations would be at first : 


    -https://docs.github.com/en/packages/quickstart to create a github workflow and after 
    - a docker repository for the user with the command docker pull ghcr.io/...mypoctoprodproject


Thank you for the class, I hope we'll see one day !
